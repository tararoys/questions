  Kevin's Better analogy:  Build a house of legos.  That is your webpage. Now, say you want to change one brick. You would need to pack the house in a box, send it back to the lego factory, and it returns three days later with that one brick changed.  With Ajax, you can just swap out the one brick yourself.
